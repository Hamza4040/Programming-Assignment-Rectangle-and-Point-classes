In this assignment you will write two classes: A Point class and a Rectangle class to represent a point and a rectangle in a 2 dimensional coordinate space. You will write the definitions for these two classes so that the client code provided in rectangleClient.py file works as expected. Here are the detailed instructions: RectangleAndPointClasses.pdf. PLEASE read the instructions carefully including the description of the coordinate frame explained in the Appendix.

Submit the program in a file with a name first_last_rectangle.py. Make sure to add a block-comment at the start of the file that lists assignment title, class name, date, your name, and assignment description.

Let me know if you have questions.
